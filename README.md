## Problem

While government schools have been promised a multitudinous array of excellent features, they have been unable to deliver quality, holistic education. Based on reports and surveys conducted by team Sandhi in the Government Girls School in two villages, Jharsa and Kanhai - the root cause of the poor performance get concentrated to:

#### Inefficient Incentives
> Measures to incentivise school going children have failed to generate the required wave of permutation, primarily due to the poor implementation of schemes.

#### Unqualified and Lack of Teachers
>Education officers have themselves admitted that the qualification of teachers (PUC + D.Ed) is insufficient. The low number of teachers is supplemented with a lack in the comprehension and improper teaching methodologies.

#### Poor Infrastructure
>Basic facilities like washrooms, physical education grounds are lacking, completely destroying the idea of a conducive environment for education.

#### Unsupportive Families
>Parents are indifferent to their child's learning due to the lack of awareness regarding the benefits of education. 

There is also longstanding neglect, insufficient financing and accountability, and a lack of motivation among teachers to pay special attention to children from lower castes.

## Solution

Sandhi - The Connect proposes a two-fold solution that, if implemented properly, has the potential to revolutionize the entire spectrum of education in government schools.

#### In-person Education (currently implemented)
> In this segment, private schools build teams of interested and capable students that create a provision for buddy mentoring - based on a peer education system. This team could organize seminars or discussions on personality development, communication, education on a regular basis. They have micro exchange programs, co-curricular activities, day camps, subject clubs and house systems to facilitate healthy competition. Government schools collaborate with local administration and derive resources to hone the skills of their students.

#### Cloud-based Learning (future prospects)
> Based on surveys conducted by Team Sandhi, almost every student has at least one mobile device that is capable of connecting to the internet. In this segment, we intend to build a web-based virtual school which allows instructors and learners to connect remotely to shared immersive thematic classrooms. This platform will comprise quality open-source educational content like MITOCW and Khan Academy. This ensures that such students have proper access to podcasts and videos of their curriculum that they can follow at home, at their own pace.
